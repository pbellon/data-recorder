## What is data-recorder ? 
Let's start with the name, it's a good way to introduce things. Data-recorder allows
you to record data then export this data into to a CSV or a JSON file. 

You can see data-recorder as a simplified spreadsheet app.

## How is it different from my favorite spreadsheet app ?

Data-recorder is focused on recording real things into data files, that's it. 
You won't be able to perform a query on your data inside data-recorder or
add formulas (like SUM, COUNT etc..). 

## So what it is exactly ? 
> Enter great explanation here

## Prerequisites
- npm
- bower

## How to install ?
```sh
npm install && bower install
``` 

This application is a pure front-end app, no server here, everything lies in the
browser. To produce the static files run `gulp build` or `gulp serve` if you want 
to serve it as a local server. 


## Todo 
Please note that this app is still being developed and far from being usable,
here is what needs to be done:

- complete the creation/edition of data types interface
- complete the creation/editions of records
- test coverage for core features
